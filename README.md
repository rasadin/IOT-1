# IOT-1
This is a special IoT system for real-time Shrimp Farm monitoring. The system consists of several sensors are used to measuring physical and chemical parameters of the Shrimp Farm. Old-fashioned (manual) monitoring system is totally time-consuming and never performed in real time. On behalf of this situation, a real-time shrimp farm monitoring system is elaborated throughout this project.
